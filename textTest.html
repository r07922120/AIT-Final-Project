    <p id="word">Classic geospatial network visualization tends to limit itself to 2D
        representation by organizing edges and nodes on a 2D map or the
        external surface of a traditional globe model. Due to the visual
        clutter caused by a large amount of edge crossings and node-edge
        overlaps, efficient exploration of geospatial network visualization
        becomes challenging when the positions of the nodes in the
        network data are unchangeable as they carry useful geographical
        information. This paper proposes the Sphere Immersive Model
        and a dedicated VR interaction method for the intuitive
        exploration of geospatial networks. To reduce visual clutter and
        reveal network patterns, we also propose a parametrizable 5-step
        3D edge bundling algorithm and an approach to avoiding collision
        of network edges with the viewpoint. Our SIM and 3D edge
        bundling approaches have been implemented for an Oculus Rift
        environment. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with
        a case study on a real-world network dataset.</p>
